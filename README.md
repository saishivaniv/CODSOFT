Internship Tasks Submission Repository.

Welcome to my Codsoft repository!
Here, you'll find the collection of the tasks that I've completed as part of my internship experience.

Inside this repository: - Organized files for each task, with clear documentation and code.

1. CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION:
   Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Uses a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

2. BANK CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION:
   Developed a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

3. HANDWRITTEN TEXT GENERATION:
   Implement a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text. Train the model on a dataset of handwritten text examples, and let it generate new text based on the learned patterns.

   Thanks to CodSoft for providing this opportunity.
